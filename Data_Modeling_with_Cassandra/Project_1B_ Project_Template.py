# # Part I. ETL Pipeline for Pre-Processing the Files

# ## PLEASE RUN THE FOLLOWING CODE FOR PRE-PROCESSING THE FILES

# #### Import Python packages 

# In[5]:


# Import Python packages 
import pandas as pd
import cassandra
import re
import os
import glob
import numpy as np
import json
import csv


# #### Creating list of filepaths to process original event csv data files

# In[6]:


# checking your current working directory
print(os.getcwd())

# Get your current folder and subfolder event data
filepath = os.getcwd() + '/event_data'

# Create a for loop to create a list of files and collect each filepath
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(filepath):
    
# join the file path and roots with the subdirectories using glob
    file_path_list = glob.glob(os.path.join(root,'*'))
    #print(file_path_list)


# #### Processing the files to create the data file csv that will be used for Apache Casssandra tables

# In[7]:


# initiating an empty list of rows that will be generated from each file

# # Part II. Complete the Apache Cassandra coding portion of your project. 
# 
# ## Now you are ready to work with the CSV file titled <font color=red>event_datafile_new.csv</font>, located within the Workspace directory.  The event_datafile_new.csv contains the following columns: 
# - artist 
# - firstName of user
# - gender of user
# - item number in session
# - last name of user
# - length of the song
# - level (paid or free song)
# - location of the user
# - sessionId
# - song title
# - userId
# 
# The image below is a screenshot of what the denormalized data should appear like in the <font color=red>**event_datafile_new.csv**</font> after the code above is run:<br>
# 
# <img src="images/image_event_datafile_new.jpg">

# ## Begin writing your Apache Cassandra code in the cells below

# #### Creating a Cluster

# In[9]:


# This should make a connection to a Cassandra instance your local machine 
# (127.0.0.1)

from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
cluster = Cluster()

# To establish connection and begin executing queries, need a session
session = cluster.connect()


# #### Create Keyspace

# In[10]:


session.execute("""
    CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS mykeyspace 
    WITH REPLICATION = 
    { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1 }""")


# #### Set Keyspace

# In[11]:


# TO-DO: Set KEYSPACE to the keyspace specified above
session.set_keyspace('mykeyspace')


# ### Now we need to create tables to run the following queries. Remember, with Apache Cassandra you model the database tables on the queries you want to run.

# ## Create queries to ask the following three questions of the data
# 
# ### 1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during  sessionId = 338, and itemInSession  = 4
# 
# 
# ### 2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
#     
# 
# ### 3. Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'
# 
# 
# 

# In[12]:
